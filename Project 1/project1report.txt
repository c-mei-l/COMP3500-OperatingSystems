~~Experience Report~~

1. Setting up my Linux environment:
I code on a Mac, so setting up my Linux environment was not a super difficult task. Thanks to my Software Construction class, I have a fairly basic understanding of connecting and using this environment. 

2. Using Linux Commands:
Again, after taking a previous class, I have had prior experience with using simple commands. The only small issue I ran into had to do with some performance anxiety when creating the script file which caused me to restart a few times. 

3. Creating Reports to Get to Know my System:
I really had no issues with this step of the project once I figured out the syntax for using the pipe. 

4. Using the Editor, Compiler, Libraries, and Debugger 
The first issue that I had with the compiler had to do with the version of the compiler that I was using. The first error I got had to do with declaring variables in the for loop. Once that was changed, I had no issues compiling and running my program (after figuring out that I was supposed to run my executable file and not my source code).
