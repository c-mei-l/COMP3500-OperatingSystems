Source Code 
(1) open.h
(2) open.cpp
(3) read.h
(4) read.cpp
(5) stats.h
(6) stats.cpp
(7) scheduler.h
(8) scheduler.cpp

How to manually compile the above multiple source code files?
$g++ -std=c++11 open.c
$g++ -std=c++11 read.c
$g++ -std=c++11 print.c
$gcc open.o read.o print.o scheduler.c -o scheduler

How to run the executable file - scheduler? (Must include which policy)
$./scheduler task.list FCFS
$./scheduler task.list RR
$./scheduler task.list SRTF

(task.list can be changed to any test file in the directory)


How to compile using the Makefile?
$make
